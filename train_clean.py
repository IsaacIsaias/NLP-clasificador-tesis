#PREPROCESSING DATA

# Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by
# a ü§ó Transformers Tokenizer which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs
# (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put
# it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.
#
# To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained method, which will ensure:
#
#     we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
#     we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.
#
# That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.

from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, use_fast=True)

tokenizer("Hello, this one sentence!", "And this sentence goes with it.")

# Depending on the model you selected, you will see different keys in the dictionary returned by
# the cell above. They don't matter much for what we're doing here (just know they are required by
# the model we will instantiate later), you can learn more about them in this tutorial
# if you're interested.
#
# To preprocess our dataset, we will thus need the names of the columns containing the sentence(s).
# The following dictionary keeps track of the correspondence task to column names:


task_to_keys = {
    "cola": ("sentence", None),
    "mnli": ("premise", "hypothesis"),
    "mnli-mm": ("premise", "hypothesis"),
    "mrpc": ("sentence1", "sentence2"),
    "qnli": ("question", "sentence"),
    "qqp": ("question1", "question2"),
    "rte": ("sentence1", "sentence2"),
    "sst2": ("sentence", None),
    "stsb": ("sentence1", "sentence2"),
    "wnli": ("sentence1", "sentence2"),
}


sentence1_key, sentence2_key = task_to_keys[task]
if sentence2_key is None:
    print(f"Sentence: {dataset['train'][0][sentence1_key]}")
else:
    print(f"Sentence 1: {dataset['train'][0][sentence1_key]}")
    print(f"Sentence 2: {dataset['train'][0][sentence2_key]}")

# We can them write the function that will preprocess our samples.
# We just feed them to the tokenizer with the argument truncation=True.
# This will ensure that an input longer that what the model selected can handle
# will be truncated to the maximum length accepted by the model.

def preprocess_function(examples):
    if sentence2_key is None:
        return tokenizer(examples[sentence1_key], truncation=True)
    return tokenizer(examples[sentence1_key], examples[sentence2_key], truncation=True)


# This function works with one or several examples.
# In the case of several examples, the tokenizer will return a list of lists for each key:

preprocess_function(dataset['train'][:5])

# To apply this function on all the sentences (or pairs of sentences) in our dataset,
# we just use the map method of our dataset object we created earlier.
# This will apply the function on all the elements of all the splits in dataset, so our training,
# validation and testing data will be preprocessed in one single command.

encoded_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

# Even better, the results are automatically cached by the ü§ó Datasets library to avoid
# spending time on this step the next time you run your notebook.
# The ü§ó Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function
# you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data).
# For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the
# first cell and rerun the notebook. ü§ó Datasets warns you when it
# uses cached files, you can pass load_from_cache_file=False in the call
# to map to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

# Note that we passed batched=True to encode the texts by batches together.
# This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier,
# which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.


#Fine-tuning the model

# Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it.
# Since all our tasks are about sentence classification, we use the AutoModelForSequenceClassification
# class. Like with the tokenizer, the from_pretrained method will download and cache the model for us.
# The only thing we have to specify is the number of labels for our problem
# (which is always 2, except for STS-B which is a regression problem and MNLI where we have 3 labels):

num_labels = 3 if task.startswith("mnli") else 1 if task=="stsb" else 2
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, num_labels=num_labels)

# The warning is telling us we are throwing away some weights (the vocab_transform and vocab_layer_norm
# layers) and randomly initializing some other (the pre_classifier and classifier layers).
# This is absolutely normal in this case, because we are removing the head used to pretrain the
# model on a masked language modeling objective and replacing it with a new head for which
# we don't have pretrained weights, so the library warns us we should fine-tune this model ' \
# 'before using it for inference, which is exactly what we are going to do.
#
# To instantiate a Trainer, we will need to define two more things. The most important is the
# TrainingArguments, which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training.
# It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all
# other arguments are optional:

metric_name = "pearson" if task == "stsb" else "matthews_correlation" if task == "cola" else "accuracy"
model_name = model_checkpoint.split("/")[-1]

args = TrainingArguments(
    f"{model_name}-finetuned-{task}",
    evaluation_strategy = "epoch",
    save_strategy = "epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model=metric_name,
    push_to_hub=True,
)


# Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use
# the batch_size defined at the top of the notebook and customize the number of epochs for
# training, as well as the weight decay. Since the best model might not be the one at the end of
# training, we ask the Trainer to load the best model it saved (according to metric_name) at the
# end of training.
#
# The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the Hub regularly during training.
# Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to
# save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed,
# or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the hub_model_id argument
# to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance "sgugger/bert-finetuned-mrpc" or "huggingface/bert-finetuned-mrpc").
#
# The last thing to define for our Trainer is how to compute the metrics from the predictions.
# We need to define a function for this, which will just use the metric we loaded earlier, the only
# preprocessing we have to do is to take the argmax of our predicted logits (our just squeeze the last
# axis in the case of STS-B):

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    predictions, labels = eval_pred
    if task != "stsb":
        predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    else:
        predictions = predictions[:, 0]
    return metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)

#Then we just need to pass all of this along with our datasets to the Trainer:

validation_key = "validation_mismatched" if task == "mnli-mm" else "validation_matched" if task == "mnli" else "validation"
trainer = Trainer(
    model,
    args,
    train_dataset=encoded_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=encoded_dataset[validation_key],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)

# You might wonder why we pass along the tokenizer when we already preprocessed our data.
# This is because we will use it once last time to make all the samples we gather the same
# length by applying padding, which requires knowing the model's '
# preferences regarding padding (to the left or right? with which token?).
# The tokenizer has a pad method that will do all of this right for us, and the Trainer will use it.
# You can customize this part by defining and passing your own data_collator which will receive the
# samples like the dictionaries seen above and will need to return a dictionary of tensors.


trainer.train()

# We can check with the evaluate method that our
# Trainer did reload the best model properly (if it was not the last one):

trainer.evaluate()

# To see how your model fared you can compare it to the GLUE Benchmark leaderboard.
#
# You can now upload the result of the training to the Hub, just execute this instruction:

trainer.push_to_hub()

# You can now share this model with all your friends, family, favorite pets: they can all load it with
# the identifier "your-username/the-name-you-picked" so for instance:

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("sgugger/my-awesome-model")



#We can now finetune our model by just calling the train method:
